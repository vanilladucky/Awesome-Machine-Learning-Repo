# Awesome-Machine-Learning-Repo
(Nearly) All you need to know about Machine Learning

### Inspiration

I have always been a big fan of understanding concepts from the foundation. When I first got into the world of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, that is the approach I took too. Thankfully, I have a strong pre-university mathematics background so understanding concepts from the ground up was an exciting journey for me. This got me inspired to share what I have learnt so far with others who might want to hop onto a similar path that I am taking. 

### Contents

I have and am planning on filling up this repository with explanations and guides about any topics related to the field of Machine Learning. More directories will be added in the future!
